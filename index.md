##### Fun Fact:
* Climate at a Glance is created from [NOAAGlobalTemp](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/noaa-global-temp) dataset which includes land surface air (LSAT) temperature from the [Global Historical Climatology Network monthly (GHCNm)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-monthly) and sea surface temperature (SST) from [Extended Reconstructed SST (ERSST)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/extended-reconstructed-sst).
* According to this [paper](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/33/4/jcli-d-19-0395.1.xml), \"LSAT has been measured by meteorological stations since the late 1600s, and SST has been measured by commercial ships since the early 1700s and by moored and drifting buoy floats since the 1970s.\"
* There is a weather station in San Francisco Downtown.\

# About Me:
![Ed's Bio Picture](img/bio.jpg)
Hey there! It's Ed. I am a technical consultant by trade. Having witnessed the [Organe Skies Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Skies_Day) in 2020 when I was living in [Emeryville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeryville,_California) (San Francisco East Bay), I want to find ways to equip ourselves to respond and adapt to this new world we live in. While having a general interest in the space industry, I didn’t always have a strong interest in earth data science until my recent experience at [GNSS+R 2023](https://igs.org/event/ieee-gnssr-2023/) and [ESIP 2023 Summer Meeting](https://www.esipfed.org/meetings). Space up, space down, so to speak. Right now, I am learning geoprocessing with Python at CU Boulder. I am excited to find out where I fit and how I can contribute with my skills. I am the happiest with my little cup of expresso. Open to connect!
