![Ed's Bio Picture](img/bio.jpg)
Hey there! It's Ed. I am a technical consultant by trade. Having witnessed the [Organe Skies Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Skies_Day) in 2020 when I was living in [Emeryville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeryville,_California) (San Francisco East Bay), I want to find ways to equip ourselves to respond and adapt to this new world we live in. While having a general interest in the space industry, I didnâ€™t always have a strong interest in earth data science until my recent experience at [GNSS+R 2023](https://igs.org/event/ieee-gnssr-2023/) and [ESIP 2023 Summer Meeting](https://www.esipfed.org/meetings). Space up, space down, so to speak. Right now, I am learning geoprocessing with Python at CU Boulder. I am excited to find out where I fit and how I can contribute with my skills. I am the happiest with my little cup of expresso. Open to connect!
